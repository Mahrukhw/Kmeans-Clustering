# Kmeans-Clustering
Dataset of delivery fleet driver data. For each driver we have two features: mean distance driven per day and the mean percentage of time a driver was >5 mph over the speed limit.  1. Run the K-Means algorithm on this dataset and find the optimal number of clusters. What insights can you gather from these clusters?
